        Hello, I'm Kristian!, proudly hailing from the beautiful city of Trondheim. My passion<br> 
        lies in backend programming, with a particular fondness for JavaScript. My journey into<br> 
        programming began as a self-taught enthusiast, delving into the intricacies of JavaScript<br>
        to hone my skills.<br>
        <br>
        To formalize and deepen my understanding, I dedicated a year to studying backend<br>
        development at Noroff, a vocational education at a higher education level.<br> 
        This immersive experience significantly enriched my knowledge<br>
        and provided a structured foundation for my programming endeavors.<br>
        <br>
        Beyond the screen, I find joy in staying activeâ€”whether it's working out, strolling<br>
        through the serene forest, or embracing the tranquility of camping. Time with friends<br>
        and family is invaluable to me, offering a perfect balance to my tech-centric pursuits. <br>
        <br>
        In the ever-evolving realm of backend development, I'm committed to continuous <br>
        learning, always striving to stay ahead of the curve. Self-development is a constant<br>
        pursuit as I aspire to be not just a backend developer but a proficient and innovative<br>
        one.<br>
        <br>
        Let's code and explore the backend together!
